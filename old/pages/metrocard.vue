  # MetroCard

  ``` ! This project had been on hold, and its date of resumption is yet to be decided```

  MetroCard is a niche spigot plugin made to emulate the IC contactless payment cards you see and used
  when taking public transport or even paying with it. It's made base on realistic approach which 
  balance of the card is stored on the card itself rather than directly modifying the players' economy balance

  ## Planned Features:

  - Card signs
    - Direct payment signs
    - Station gate [when linked with PixRail Core]
    - Charging signs
  
  - New card issue
  - Card management
